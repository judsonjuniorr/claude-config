## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.3.0] - 2026-06-22

### Removed
- `/herow-dev:python:review`, `/herow-dev:react:review`, `/herow-dev:python:fastapi-review` — the three standalone review commands are **consolidated into `/herow-dev:code:review`**, which already dispatches the matching specialist reviewers by changed-file language (`.tsx`/`.jsx` → `react-reviewer` + `typescript-reviewer`; `.ts`/`.js` → `typescript-reviewer`; `.py`, FastAPI-aware → `fastapi-reviewer` + `python-reviewer`). The per-language reviewer **agents are unchanged** — only the redundant command entry points are gone, making `code:review` the single review door with one consistent output format (its REPORT phase owns formatting).

### Changed
- README, `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, and the `herow-dev:prompt-optimizer` reference tables now present `code:review` as the single **language-aware** review door (reframed for discoverability — "auto-detects `.tsx`/`.ts`/`.py` → specialist reviewers" — instead of listing per-language commands).
- `react-reviewer` agent: `## Related` footer repointed to the React authoring rules that exist (dropped the dangling `rules/react/hooks.md` reference) and reframed as the canonical authoring source the review lanes map onto.

## [0.1.2.0] - 2026-06-18

### Changed
- `herow-dev:prompt-optimizer` now **blocks on `AskUserQuestion` before generating any output** when material context gaps are detected. Phase 4 classifies each gap as material (answer would change the generated prompt) or non-material (sensible default applies); material gaps trigger a batched `AskUserQuestion` call with 2–4 concrete options per question, and the optimized prompt is only produced after all answers are received. The old escape hatch (listing open questions alongside the prompt) is removed.
- `herow-dev:prompt-optimizer` Section 1 renamed from "Needs Clarification" to "Assumptions & resolved clarifications" — it now records answers collected via `AskUserQuestion` and non-material defaults applied, never unanswered questions.

## [0.1.1.0] - 2026-06-15

### Added
- Three new global operating-rule files in `herow-core/rules/common/`: `verify-before-claiming.md`, `scope-and-safety.md`, and `judgment-and-craft.md` — AI behavior rules from Fable5 covering confirmed-vs-inferred claim discipline, operational scope/safety (rollback protocol, blast-radius framing, prompt-injection guard), and judgment at decision forks (recommendation-first, evidence grounding, honest status close)
- `/herow-dev:code:review` — **language-aware dispatch** (Phase 2.5): automatically detects changed file extensions and runs the matching specialist agents in parallel with the generic review agents. `.tsx`/`.jsx` → `react-reviewer` + `typescript-reviewer`; `.ts`/`.js` → `typescript-reviewer`; `.py` (with FastAPI detected via project files or diff) → `fastapi-reviewer` + `python-reviewer`; no match → no language agents. All rows are additive for multi-language diffs.
- `/herow-dev:code:review` — **second-opinion pass** (Phase 3.5 / Phase 4.5): serializes surviving findings to a compact JSON array, probes for `codex` → `agy` → Claude subagent, invokes with a CONFIRM/DISPUTE/ESCALATE reviewer prompt, and applies verdicts: `ESCALATE` raises severity one level (feeding the PR DECIDE table); `DISPUTE` keeps the finding but flags it and excludes it from `--fix`. Includes parse-failure recovery and a sanitization step to prevent hostile diffs from injecting instructions into the second-opinion prompt.
- `/herow-dev:code:review` — **unified report format**: every finding now carries an inline verdict badge (`🔴 Critical · ✅ CONFIRM — title`); `DISPUTE`/`ESCALATE` findings get a trailing `2nd opinion: <note>` line; the count line gains a second-opinion summary suffix (`🔴 1  🟠 2  🟡 3  🟢 0   (2nd opinion: ✅2 ⚠️1 ⏫1)`). Badge is omitted when the second-opinion pass produced no verdicts.

### Changed
- Commands and agents no longer pin a `model:` in frontmatter — every execution and subagent now inherits the **default input model** (the model selected for the session). Skills keep their `model:` pins.
- `token-guard.sh` no longer sets `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL`; it now **removes** any existing pin so subagents inherit the session model. The session default (`model: opusplan`, `advisorModel: opus`, `effortLevel: high`, `autoCompact: true`) is unchanged.
- `detect.sh`/`verify.sh`: the subagent-model check now flags/asserts that no `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` pin is present.

### Fixed
- `/herow-dev:execute` and `/herow-dev:quick` model guardrail now detects the `[1m]` (1M-context) suffix — the real cause of "Usage credits required for 1M context" — instead of checking tier, and fails open when the model is unknown (no false positives).

## [0.1.0.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added
- `token-guard.sh` — new setup step that automatically applies token-saving defaults to `~/.claude/settings.json`: `model: opusplan` (Sonnet for all normal work, Opus with 1M context only when plan mode is active), `advisorModel: opus`, `effortLevel: high`, `autoCompact: true`, and `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL: claude-sonnet-4-6` to pin all subagents to Sonnet regardless of parent model
- `/herow-core:setup` Step 4.5 wires token-guard automatically — runs on every setup with no user approval needed
- `detect.sh` reports missing token optimizations as `opt|` records in the Step 1 inventory, now even on fresh machines (before `settings.json` exists)
- `verify.sh` checks all five token settings post-install (`model`, `effortLevel`, `advisorModel`, `autoCompact`, `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL`)
- `/herow-dev:execute` frontmatter now enforces `model: sonnet` — was documented in a comment but not enforced
- `/herow-dev:quick` frontmatter now enforces `model: sonnet`
- Model guardrail added to `/herow-dev:execute` and `/herow-dev:quick` — detects if the active session is not Sonnet and shows `claude --model claude-sonnet-4-6` as a copy-paste one-liner

### Fixed
- `token-guard.sh`: atomic write via `tempfile + os.replace` prevents settings corruption on disk-full or interrupted runs
- `token-guard.sh`: `"env": null` and non-dict roots in `settings.json` no longer crash silently — guarded with type checks
- `token-guard.sh`: bootstrap safely creates `~/.claude/` directory if it doesn't exist yet
- `detect.sh`: `opt|` block no longer gated on `[ -f "$SETTINGS" ]` — fresh machines without a settings file now correctly surface all missing token optimizations
