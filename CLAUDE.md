## Communication style

- Direct answers. No filler, no preamble ("Great question!", "Certainly!").
- Short sentences. Skip narration of what you're about to do.
- Run tools first → show result → stop. Don't explain the tool call itself.
- Example: say `Use async` instead of `The solution here is to use async`.

## Output hygiene

- Do **NOT** generate reference guides, summary docs, or any `.md` documentation files unless the user explicitly asks.
- No "here's what I did" recap after a small edit. The diff is the recap.

## 1. Think before coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

- State assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity first

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Test: *"Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?"* If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that **your** changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

Test: every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-driven execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass.
- "Fix the bug" → write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass.
- "Refactor X" → ensure tests pass before and after.

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria enable independent looping. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.
